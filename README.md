# Visualization of Solar Radio Outburst

A Minor Project Report On "Visualization of Solar Radio Outburst"

This project is about designing an instrumentation system capable to receive solar radio outbursts ranging from 30 MHz to 150 MHz via a receiver antenna and visualizing the received radio outburst signal through MatLab in terms of radiation pattern and thermal diagrams. Furthermore, the data is analyzed for prediction in the region of consideration.
